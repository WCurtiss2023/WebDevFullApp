This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#Questions From Assignment on Canvas

1. For the design principles, I tried to follow a retro kind of design scheme, using pixelated video game looking text/font called 'Press Start 2P' from https://fontmeme.com/fonts/press-start-2p-font/#google_vignette, and a black and white old school looking color pallette. I used flex box and containers to orangize the elements of the page.

2. Pokemon is one of the top 25 highest grossing media franchises of all time worldwide, earning a total of 92 billion dollars in revenue. This application allows you to look up information of every pokemon ever created, over 1000 different species. This can be valuable for several reasons:
  - it can be challenging for even dedicated fans to keep track of all their characteristics, abilities, evolutions, and movesets, having this app that consolidates all this information into one easily searchable database is invaluable
  - those who participate in competitive Pokémon battles, having quick access to information about each Pokémon's base stats, typing, and abilities is crucial for strategy
  - this app also has potential to foster a sense of community among Pokémon fans

3. The site looks good and works on multiple screen sizes.

4. Here is the Netlify URL again: https://663bb11ce4a6a307a71d56ad--transcendent-arithmetic-c80009.netlify.app/

5. This site uses state to keep track of which Pokemon has been selected by the user for further information, and displays says information of selected pokemon at the top of the page.

6. The site fetches data from a third party api: https://pokeapi.co/

7.  The site persist data using a third-party tool or database.
